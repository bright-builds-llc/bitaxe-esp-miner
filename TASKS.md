# Tasks

This is the repository's sole active work tracker. Use one stable, timestamped
task block per unit of work. Update only that block as work progresses, record
the verification performed, and finish with a concise completion review.

Historical plans, milestones, debug sessions, and task records under
`.planning/milestones/` are evidence and context only. They do not authorize
new work.

No task is currently in progress.

## Backlog

### task-private-first-remaining-evidence-pipelines | 2026-07-20 | Migrate remaining evidence workflows

- [ ] Inventory active evidence-producing workflows outside the archived
  Phase 35 workflow against `docs/parity/evidence-policy.md`.
- [ ] Migrate any active workflow that still performs in-place or post-write
  sanitization to private-first capture with a distinct shareable projection.
- [ ] Add focused regressions and route every admitted projection through
  `just verify-redaction`.
- [ ] Run the repository verification required for every changed language and
  workflow surface.

Verification: Pending.

Completion review: Pending. This task does not authorize hardware, credentials,
network access, device mutation, evidence promotion, or push operations.

### task-cross-platform-device-session-adapters | 2026-07-22 | Qualify Linux and Windows ESP device sessions

- [ ] Implement Linux physical/enumeration identity, exclusive ownership,
  receive-only observation, and bounded reacquisition behind the canonical
  device-session contract.
- [ ] Implement the corresponding Windows adapter without weakening
  exclusive ownership, request-once, or private-artifact guarantees.
- [ ] Add platform-native real-process tests.
- [ ] Keep unsupported platforms fail-closed until each exact adapter and its
  separately authorized hardware evidence qualify.

Verification: Pending.

Completion review: Pending. macOS remains the only production adapter. This
task does not itself authorize hardware, credentials, network discovery, direct
UART or pin work, evidence promotion, or push operations.

## Effectful Hardware Task Gate

Standing permission for safe USB interaction remains subject to `AGENTS.md` and
`docs/hardware/hardware-attempt-policy.md`. Before any effectful hardware run,
move or add one task block under `Active` that explicitly records:

- the exact permitted repo-owned command and objective;
- the evidence destination, privacy class, and redaction policy;
- recovery, restoration, and cleanup procedures;
- retry bounds, including the unchanged-boundary stop rule; and
- accepted terminal categories and stop conditions.

If any field is missing, hardware work is not authorized. A task entry never
expands the direct-UART, pin-manipulation, privacy, safety, or archived-lineage
boundaries in `AGENTS.md`.

## Accepted Debt and Constraints

- Milestone v1.2 is administratively closed with gaps and is not a release.
- Phase 36 stopped after 8 of 10 plans. Plans 36-07 and 36-04 did not complete.
- SYS-02, EVD-11, EVD-12, and EVD-14 remain blocked. EVD-15 is satisfied by
  exact preservation, typed demotion, and explicit non-claims.
- The sole final Phase 36 hardware attempt sealed `sealed_non_promotion`,
  produced no candidate, and left device restoration unresolved.
- Do not repeat the unchanged hardware attempt. A future attempt requires new
  diagnostic information, a targeted regression-backed fix or objectively
  verified non-invasive remediation, and a complete task-scoped hardware
  contract under the gate above.
- Administrative closure, software verification, or task completion alone is
  never hardware or parity evidence.
