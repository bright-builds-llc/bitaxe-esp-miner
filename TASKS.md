# Tasks

This is the repository's sole active work tracker. Use one stable, timestamped
task block per unit of work. Update only that block as work progresses, record
the verification performed, and finish with a concise completion review.

`TASKS.archive.md` is the append-only historical store, not an active tracker.
After a task is completed, explicitly cancelled, or superseded, append its full
final record there and remove it from this file in the same commit. Keep
blocked, deferred, terminal-blocker, future, and otherwise unresolved tasks
here. Stable task IDs must be unique across both files. Never restore or select
an archived task; create a new active task with a new ID and an archived-task
reference for follow-up work.

Task blocks under `## Future — Explicit Only` remain incomplete but are
excluded from automatic task selection, including repeated top-task loops.
Only a current request that names the exact stable task ID makes one future
task a selection candidate; that opt-in does not bypass dependencies,
environment, authorization, verification, or safety gates. When only future
tasks remain, the automatic queue is exhausted, but the tracker is not fully
complete.

Historical plans, milestones, debug sessions, and task records under
`.planning/milestones/` are evidence and context only. They do not authorize
new work.

## Active

### task-ultra205-default-profile-soak | 2026-07-28 | Run the bounded upstream-default mining soak

- [x] Start a fresh exact-package attempt at 485 MHz, 1200 mV, and 100% fan
      only after the conservative live-share task completes.
- [x] Count 600 seconds from authorized active mining rather than boot or
      connection start.
- [ ] Require uninterrupted fresh safety truth, watchdog responsiveness,
      active work renewal, at least one new correlated nonce and pool response,
      and correlated HTTP/WebSocket state throughout the soak.
- [ ] Confirm the device-local lease expires, hardware safe-stop completes,
      the lease is cleared, `mineonboot=false` persists, pool settings remain,
      and the new firmware remains installed in paused state.
- [x] Seal one private, redacted soak result without automatic parity
      promotion.

Dependencies: Complete `task-ultra205-live-pool-share` successfully.

Hardware contract:

- Permitted commands:
  1. `just detect-ultra205`
  2. `just package`
  3. `just mining-campaign stage=soak profile=upstream-default board=205 port=<detector-port> manifest=bazel-bin/firmware/bitaxe/bitaxe-ultra205-package.json wifi-credentials=wifi-credentials.json pool-credentials=<single-ignored-local-pool-file> evidence-dir=scratch/ultra205-default-profile-soak/attempt-002 duration-seconds=600 redact-evidence=true`
- Objective: prove the exact package can mine for 600 active seconds at the
  Ultra 205 upstream-default profile with fresh safety, watchdog,
  work/result/share, HTTP, WebSocket, and final safe-stop evidence.
- Evidence: the ignored
  `scratch/ultra205-default-profile-soak/attempt-002` root is private,
  non-promoted `ProtectedOperational` evidence with mode-0700 parent and
  mode-0600 artifacts. Only `pool_config: local-owner-supplied`, closed
  categories, bounded counts/durations, and safe provenance may be summarized;
  the same secret and device-identifier denylist as the live-share task
  applies.
- Preconditions: the live-share task completed with one correlated submit
  response and confirmed safe-stop; all software gates pass against fresh
  current HEAD; the exact package is frozen; exactly one board 205 is admitted;
  and the ignored Wi-Fi and single pool credential inputs remain available
  without being printed.
- Allowed effects: private NVS credential injection, persistence of
  `mineonboot=false`, installation of one 600-active-second default-profile
  lease, exact package flash, repo-owned USB reset/re-enumeration, fan 100%,
  DS4432U 1200 mV, ASIC enable/reset, BM1366 initialization and work/result
  traffic, Stratum V1 TCP connection and submissions, fresh-session
  HTTP/WebSocket observation, and bounded device-local safe-stop.
- Safety and stop limits: the live-share limits remain unchanged: fresh
  observations, 4.5-5.5 V input, at most 15 W, ASIC temperature below 75 C,
  and fresh nonzero fan RPM after the 100% command. Any safety, watchdog,
  transport, generation, actuation, lease, telemetry-correlation, or evidence
  fault blocks work and begins safe-stop.
- Prohibited effects: TLS, Stratum V2, automatic fan mode, mining beyond the
  lease, non-205 hardware, erase-flash, arbitrary raw writes, OTA, recovery
  upload, network discovery, foreign-process termination, raw secret output,
  parity promotion, direct UART, pins, pads, headers, GPIO, probes, jumpers,
  soldering, injected signals, voltage/fan stress, or fault injection.
- Recovery/restoration: preserve the earliest typed failure; block and
  invalidate submissions; close owned pool transports; frequency-down and
  reset the ASIC; set core voltage off and ASIC enable off; keep fan at 100%
  until fresh temperature is at or below 45 C, then set 30%; clear the lease;
  persist `mineonboot=false`; retain pool settings; and release owned USB and
  process resources. If device-local stop cannot be confirmed, one
  predeclared exact-baseline reflash is allowed only after same-device
  re-admission; otherwise stop.
- Retry bound: one fresh attempt only and no unchanged retry. A later ordinal
  requires a targeted regression-backed fix or authorized non-invasive
  remediation with objective boundary-change proof; one post-fix recurrence
  selects `stop_repeated_boundary`.
- Attempt-002 continuation: run the exact command above once, only after the
  monitor-admission timeout policy and its 12/24/36-second regression pass all
  required software gates on a clean pushed exact HEAD. The private recovery
  summary must report `phase=monitor_admission`, `deadline_seconds=60`, and 3
  stable samples before runtime evidence can be trusted. Recurrence of the
  attempt-001 monitor boundary selects `stop_repeated_boundary` with no retry;
  any distinct boundary stops this targeted effort and is recorded without
  expanding authority.
- Accepted terminal outcomes: `complete` only when the full active-duration,
  correlation, and safe-stop criteria pass; otherwise
  `stop_repeated_boundary`, `stop_hardware_blocker`,
  `stop_authority_boundary`, or `stop_impossible_contract`.

Verification: `stop_hardware_blocker` on attempt 001. `cargo fmt --all`, strict
Clippy, the all-target/all-feature Cargo build and tests, all 82 Bazel test
targets, the managed Bright Builds checks, `just package`, and detector
admission passed against exact source commit `8e75d046`. The campaign admitted
the package and completed both supervised writes, then failed before runtime
observation. Its protected result sealed with a matching digest and recorded
`observation_failed`, zero markers, `safe_stop=not_observed`, and successful USB
cleanup. The authoritative monitor-admission recovery summary observed the same
accessible, holder-free device but reached only 2 of 3 stable samples within
the 30-second bound; final cleanup later reached 3 of 3 within 60 seconds. The
one-shot campaign keys were consumed and erased before use, and the conservative
720-second lease-plus-stop margin elapsed without another device effect, but
elapsed time is not safe-stop evidence. No unchanged retry is authorized.

Attempt-002 verification: `complete` for the targeted monitor-admission fix.
All required software gates passed and the clean exact package from source
commit `0e3f19d5` was pushed before hardware use. Fresh detector admission found
exactly one Ultra 205. The protected monitor-admission recovery summary recorded
a 60-second deadline and reached 3 of 3 same-device, accessible, holder-free
stable samples. The sealed campaign result recorded `status=accepted`,
`terminal_category=soak_duration_complete`, 600.501 active seconds, trusted
package/runtime identity, 10 accepted and zero rejected shares, fresh safety,
`mineonboot=false`, confirmed safe-stop, and USB cleanup ready. Its result seal,
mode-0700 root, mode-0600 files and recovery summaries, redaction denylist, and
non-promotion state all passed. No retry was run and no evidence was promoted.

Completion review: Targeted fix hardware-verified; broader task remains active
and is not archived. Attempt 002 proves the monitor-admission boundary, active
duration, mining/share path, safety, safe-stop, evidence seal, and USB cleanup.
The current campaign result does not contain the correlated HTTP, WebSocket, or
explicit watchdog evidence required by the broader soak contract, so those
criteria remain unverified. The task still does not authorize or verify
automatic fan control, unbounded mining, complete statistics/hashrate parity,
release readiness, or checklist promotion.

## Future — Explicit Only

### task-cross-platform-device-session-adapters | 2026-07-22 | Qualify Linux and Windows ESP device sessions

- [ ] Implement Linux physical/enumeration identity, exclusive ownership,
  receive-only observation, and bounded reacquisition behind the canonical
  device-session contract.
- [ ] Implement the corresponding Windows adapter without weakening
  exclusive ownership, request-once, or private-artifact guarantees.
- [ ] Add platform-native real-process tests.
- [ ] Keep unsupported platforms fail-closed until each exact adapter and its
  separately authorized hardware evidence qualify.

Verification: Pending.

Completion review: Pending. macOS remains the only production adapter. This
task does not itself authorize hardware, credentials, network discovery, direct
UART or pin work, evidence promotion, or push operations.

## Effectful Hardware Task Gate

Standing permission for safe USB interaction remains subject to `AGENTS.md` and
`docs/hardware/hardware-attempt-policy.md`. Before any effectful hardware run,
move or add one task block under `Active` that explicitly records:

- the exact permitted repo-owned command and objective;
- the evidence destination, privacy class, and redaction policy;
- recovery, restoration, and cleanup procedures;
- retry bounds, including the unchanged-boundary stop rule; and
- accepted terminal categories and stop conditions.

If any field is missing, hardware work is not authorized. A task entry never
expands the direct-UART, pin-manipulation, privacy, safety, or archived-lineage
boundaries in `AGENTS.md`.

## Accepted Debt and Constraints

- Milestone v1.2 is administratively closed with gaps and is not a release.
- Phase 36 stopped after 8 of 10 plans. Plans 36-07 and 36-04 did not complete.
- SYS-02, EVD-11, EVD-12, and EVD-14 remain blocked. EVD-15 is satisfied by
  exact preservation, typed demotion, and explicit non-claims.
- The sole final Phase 36 hardware attempt sealed `sealed_non_promotion`,
  produced no candidate, and left device restoration unresolved.
- Do not repeat the unchanged hardware attempt. A future attempt requires new
  diagnostic information, a targeted regression-backed fix or objectively
  verified non-invasive remediation, and a complete task-scoped hardware
  contract under the gate above.
- Administrative closure, software verification, or task completion alone is
  never hardware or parity evidence.
