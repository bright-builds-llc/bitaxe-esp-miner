2. What went wrong: A GSD summary used standalone `---` body separators after YAML frontmatter. The GSD frontmatter parser scans all `--- ... ---` blocks and selected the last body pair, so lifecycle validation ignored the real frontmatter and failed.
3. Preventive rule: In GSD artifacts and other frontmatter-parsed Markdown, use standalone `---` only for the opening and closing YAML frontmatter delimiters at the top of the file. Use headings or `***` for body breaks instead. Markdown table separator rows such as `| --- |` remain valid.
4. Trigger signal to catch it earlier: Lifecycle validation reports missing frontmatter fields even though the file visibly has them near the top, or a Markdown artifact has more than two standalone `---` lines.

2. What went wrong: Wi-Fi startup initialized the default ESP-IDF event loop through raw `esp_event_loop_create_default()` before `EspSystemEventLoop::take()`, so esp-idf-svc's ownership tracker returned `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`. The first hardware evidence run also showed that ESP-IDF Wi-Fi driver logs can expose the connected SSID outside JSON or `key=value` fields.
3. Preventive rule: Let esp-idf-svc own managed ESP-IDF service handles such as the default event loop; use raw idempotent init only for services without a wrapper ownership tracker. Redaction tests must include vendor log formats, not only project log formats.
4. Trigger signal to catch it earlier: A managed `take()` API fails with `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` immediately after a raw init call, or sanitized serial evidence still contains natural-language Wi-Fi driver lines such as `wifi:connected with ...`.
